The SILENO minimo is ideal for small lawns, combining high performance and precision with convenient mowing. Let's get started! Pick up your smart phone and use the GARDENA Bluetooth® App to enter the lawn size, desired mowing days, and preferred start time. The GARDENA Bluetooth® App guides you intuitively through the initial installation, step by step. Your Robotic Lawnmower organises a schedule and is ready to go with zero fuss. It's simple to conveniently control your SILENO minimo via Bluetooth® from up to 10 m away. Your mowing robot works out the optimum grass cutting time and the GARDENA Bluetooth® App uses its scheduling assistant to help you keep your garden just right. This mower has best in class low noise levels at only 57db(A) thanks to a particularly quiet motor. You and your neighbours can relax in peace in the garden, even when your robot is in action. The sophisticated CorridorCut guides the robot mower while it's cutting in narrow spaces and tight corners of just 60 centimetres in width between the boundary wires. CorridorCut will even agilely navigate your robot mower out of tricky dead ends. Guided by SensorControl, the robot judges for itself how often your lawn needs a trim, setting off at precisely the right frequency according to grass growth. Your clever little helper will cut the grass as efficiently as possible. An intrepid Auto Weather and Terrain hard worker, the SILENO minimo mows the lawn independently, whatever the weather, rain or shine. The clever Robotic Lawnmower notices if the ground is frozen or too frosty and the robot waits until it has thawed by pausing its programme. The boundary wire indicates to the SILENO minimo the area of garden that needs to be mown. Similarly, the guide wire directs the robotic mower reliably and fully automatically around all mowing areas. Your lawnmower will have no problems squeezing through narrow spaces and even scaling slopes or inclines of up to 25 percent. Once the job is done the hard-working robo-gardener makes its way back home to the charging station for a well-earned recharge. It mows completely autonomously, giving you more time to focus on doing the things you love in the garden. The SILENO minimo can be cleaned easily with a garden hose, it couldn't be simpler. Enjoy your time in the garden with SILENO minimo, just sit back, relax and let the little robotic mower do the hard work for you. Your lawn will always look wonderfully well-manicured with SILENO minimo: THE intelligent robotic lawnmower. SILENO."},

{"category": "Robotic Lawnmowers", "title": "smart system Start Set", "description": "The smart system Start Set from GARDENA allows you to water your garden optimally and to suit your exact needs, as well as allowing convenient and fully automatic lawn care. The set includes the smart SILENO city robotic lawnmower, the smart Water Control, a smart Sensor and the smart Gateway and is ready for immediate use. All elements of the GARDENA smart system are controlled by the free GARDENA smart App (iOS / Android), which you install on your smartphone or tablet. Setting up and operating your new GARDENA smart system is very easy thanks to the app's helpful assistants. You can use them to operate the smart SILENO city robotic lawnmower. With its SensorCut System it mows the lawn particularly precisely, reliably, and pleasantly quietly. It is ideal for areas up to 500 m² and can cope with slopes of up to 35% and narrow, less accessible areas. The cut grass remains on the lawn, where it can be used as natural fertiliser. The compact and precise smart Sensor has an extra-large sensor zone and measures the moisture of the soil at the roots of the plants, exactly where you need it. The measured values such as the moisture level and the current ground temperature are sent via the Internet directly to the GARDENA smart App on your smartphone or tablet via smart Gateway. You can now monitor, activate and adjust your garden's irrigation system at any time, anywhere. The watering runs via the smart Water Control, which is installed simply and directly on the tap and allows you to program various different schedules. Together with the data from the sensor, you can now irrigate your garden according to your needs and, above all, economically, saving precious water. The intelligent irrigation system ensures that your lawn and plants are only watered if the soil moisture measured by the smart Sensor falls below a certain value. This prevents the garden from being watered unnecessarily after long periods of rain. This not only protects your garden, but also saves water. The smart Water Control can be switched on and off manually at the touch of a button. In the event of frost and excessively low temperatures, the smart App warns if smooth operation can no longer be guaranteed. The app can be used to coordinate the watering times with the cutting times of the mowing robot. The smart Gateway, included in the set, is the centrepiece of your new smart system. Thanks to powerful wireless receivers, it offers a secure, stable connection with a long range. The smart Gateway is easily connected to your Internet router via WiFi or a LAN cable. The smart Sensor and the smart Water Control are powered by 2 or 3 AA batteries respectively, which allow wireless operation for a complete garden season. Never leave your garden behind. With an intelligent irrigation system and robotic lawnmower, your garden is taken care of, from anywhere."},
